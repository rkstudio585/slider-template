### Dual-Color Progress Slider
- **Description**: A sleek slider with a dual-color progress effect. The filled and unfilled portions of the track display distinct colors, visually indicating progress.

  - **Dual Color Track**: Filled section changes to a distinct color, while the unfilled area remains shaded.
  - **Gradient Thumb**: The thumb has a gradient effect that changes as it moves, providing a visually appealing contrast.

- **Features**:
  - **Pulsing Glow Effect**: The thumb has a smooth pulsing animation, drawing attention and adding visual interest.
  - **Rainbow Gradient Track**: A soft rainbow gradient fills the track, making this slider a perfect fit for modern interfaces.
  - **Dynamic Thumb Color**: The thumb color changes as it moves across different sections of the track.

## How to Use
1. **Select a Slider**: Open the corresponding HTML file for each slider style.
2. **Edit Values**: Adjust the `min`, `max`, and `value` attributes in the `<input type="range">` tag to change the slider range.
3. **Add to Your Project**: Copy the code for the desired slider into your project and customize it as needed.

## Customization
These sliders are designed to be easily customizable:
- **Colors**: Modify the color values in the CSS to adjust thumb, track, and glow effects.
- **Size and Range**: Adjust the slider’s `width`, `height`, and range values in the HTML.
- **Animations**: You can enhance or adjust the animations by modifying the `@keyframes` in the CSS section.

## Dependencies
- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for styling and responsive design.
- **jQuery**: Simplifies JavaScript manipulation for updating slider properties.
- **Optional**: Tailwind and jQuery can be replaced with your preferred CSS framework and JavaScript library, as the sliders rely on standard HTML, CSS, and JS elements.
